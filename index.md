## Welcome to the TULEPS site

The **Testing, Understanding, and Leveraging Ensemble Predictions for Space Weather** team was first formed during the workshop [_Ensemble Forecasts in Space Weather: Science and Operations_](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2019/1195/info.php3?wsid=1195&venue=Snellius) which took place at the Lorentz center in Leiden, The Netehrlands, on September 2-6, 2019.

The main goal of this working team is to coordinate, organize, and develope activities in order to advance the use of ensemble techniques in Space Weather forecasting. This team is multi-disciplinary and multi-focuse with members from different subfield of Spae Weather and Terrestrial Weather, academic institutions and operational centers.

### Starting point

The intention of this site is to provide the space weather community with a place to start developing their ensemble research. In this site you can find:

- [Important literature on ensembles](https://github.com/TULEPS/tuleps_main/blob/master/lit.md)
- [References about ensembles in Space Weather](https://github.com/TULEPS/tuleps_main/blob/master/SW_refs.md)
- [Presentations from the Workshop "Ensemble Forecasts in Space Weather: Science and Operations"](https://github.com/TULEPS/tuleps_main/blob/master/workshop_m.md)
- [Ensemble-related software (future)](https://github.com/TULEPS/tuleps_main/blob/master/soft_rep)

### Events

The TULEPS team will meet (partially) during the [Inaugural COSPAR ISWAT Meeting](https://iswat-cospar.org/wm2020) on Feb. 10 - 14, 2020 in Florida, USA.
